> Explore text corpora using token frequencies, categories, and contextual patterns.

## Project Overview

Author: James Webb

Date: 2026-11

I plan to explore a fictional fellowship orientation corpus with three
categories: logistics, systems access, and training. I will compare
frequent words and bigrams across categories and test how context
windows of two and three tokens change the words found near terms like
"badge" and "training."

## Data

The example uses a small, controlled text corpus
defined directly in the Python script.

The corpus contains 22 short documents
organized into four categories:

- Dogs.
- Cats.
- Cars.
- Trucks.

Each document includes a category label
and a short text passage.

No external input dataset or web connection is required.

## Approach

The project uses Python and Polars
to explore patterns in a labeled text corpus.

The example demonstrates:

- Representing a collection of documents as a corpus.
- Tokenizing and cleaning text.
- Computing global token frequencies.
- Comparing token frequencies across categories.
- Identifying frequently occurring words within categories.
- Examining word co-occurrence using context windows.
- Creating and counting bigrams.
- Visualizing and interpreting token distributions.

Explore these important project components:

- [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) - project identity, dependencies, and tool configuration.
- [src/nlp/nlp_corpus_explore.py](src/nlp/nlp_corpus_explore.py) - executable Python corpus analysis.
- [tests/](tests/) - automated tests.
- [.github/workflows/](.github/workflows/) - automated testing and documentation deployment.
- [docs/](docs/) - project documentation.
- [zensical.toml](zensical.toml) - documentation configuration.

The goal is to observe structure in text
before applying machine learning or language models.

## Run the Project

Follow the [Professional Python Workflow Guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/)
to set up your machine and project environment.

From a VS Code terminal in the project root:

```shell
uv run python -m nlp.nlp_corpus_explore
```

Close each visualization window after viewing
so the script can continue executing.

## Results

The analysis produces frequency distributions,
category comparisons, co-occurrence information,
and bigram frequencies.

The results demonstrate how vocabulary and
word proximity reveal patterns within a corpus.

Successful execution produces:

```shell
========================
Pipeline executed successfully!
========================
```

A `project.log` file is created in the project root.

This confirms that the Python analysis executes
and the logging system works.

## Verification

Run the automated tests:

```shell
uv run python -m pytest
```

## Project Documentation

The [hosted documentation site](https://jrwebb7.github.io/nlp-03-text-exploration-custom/)
is published using Zensical and GitHub Pages.

The documentation site is used to present the project report,
covering such sections as data, methods, results, visualizations,
interpretation, and conclusions.

## CI/CD and GitHub Actions

This project includes continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
to check project files and publish the docs.

GitHub Actions include:

- [CI: Python and Documentation Checks](https://github.com/jrwebb7/nlp-03-text-exploration-custom/actions/workflows/ci-python-zensical.yml)
- [CD: Documentation Deployment](https://github.com/jrwebb7/nlp-03-text-exploration-custom/actions/workflows/deploy-zensical.yml)

## Developer Reference

Follow the
[Professional Python Workflow Guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/)
for **detailed instructions and troubleshooting**.

### Initialize and Update the Python Environment

With the project open in VS Code, open a VS Code terminal.
Paste each command and hit Enter or Return after to run it.

```shell
uvx pup-clean --delete
uv self update
uv python pin 3.14
uv python install
uv lock --upgrade
uv sync
uv audit
```

### Set Up and Run Git Hooks

Set up and run the git hooks to perform
basic checks automatically before
any changes get pushed to GitHub.

In the VS Code terminal,
paste each command and hit Enter or Return after to run it.

```shell
uvx prek install --force
uvx prek update --freeze --cooldown-days 7

git add -A
uvx prek run --all-files
# repeat if changes were made
uvx prek run --all-files
```

### Run Common Chores

Run linters, formatters, type checks, tests, and
build the documentation.

```shell
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run ruff format .

uv run ty check
uv run python -m pytest
uv run python -m zensical build
```

### Git add-commit-push to GitHub

After making useful changes, save your work to GitHub.

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "describe your changes in quotes"
git push -u origin main
```

## Developer Notes

- Use the **UP ARROW** and **DOWN ARROW** in the terminal to scroll through past commands.
- Use `CTRL+f` to find (and replace) text within a file.
